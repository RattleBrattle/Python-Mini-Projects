# A list of Mini-Python Applications I made while learning Python Language
-I created this Repository to showcase all the applications I made while learning the Python Programming Language.

## List of Applications made:
### 1. Number Guessing game
A conversational-style game where the computer attempts to guess your secret integer (âˆ’500 to 500) by asking yes/no questions.
- **Key Concepts**:  
  - Input validation (type checks, range checks)  
  - Control flow with `while` and `if`  
  - Storing user responses and making deductions
 
### 2. Library books sorting program using OOP
A command-line library management system built with Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
#### Key Components

-**Book Class:** Models book attributes and availability status
-**Library Class:** Handles all library operations (CRUD)

Interface Functions: Bridge between user input and library operations

## Features
- **Book Management**
  - Add new books with title, author, and ISBN
  - Validate ISBN (10-13 digits) and prevent duplicates
  - Track availability status (available/borrowed)

- **Search System**
  - Find books by title
  - Display all books in clean formatted output

- **Loan Management**
  - Borrow and return books
  - Automatic status toggling

- ðŸ›  **Error Handling**
  - Input validation for all user interactions
  - Clear error messages

### 3. Letter/Word Replacement in a sentence
A Python program that modifies strings by replacing letters or words based on user input.
#### Key Functions
**switch_letters()** - Character-by-character replacement
**switch_words()** - Whole word substitution
**switch_letter_number()** - Letter-to-number conversion
Input validators (get_valid_*) ensure clean data

## Features
- **Letter Replacement**
  - Swap one letter for another
  - Replace letters with numbers
- **Word Replacement**
  - Replace entire words in sentences
- **Input Validation**
  - Ensures valid letters/words/numbers
  - Handles edge cases gracefully
- **Simple CLI Interface**
  - Clear menu-driven operation
